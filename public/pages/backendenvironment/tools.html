<h2>Git: The Fashion Archive</h2>
<p>Think of <strong>Git</strong> as your personal fashion archive. It's a version control system that lets you save snapshots of your project's code. If you mess up a look, you can just go back to a previous version. It's, like, a total lifesaver for preventing major fashion disasters.</p>

<h2>Nodemon: The Quick Touch-up Artist</h2>
<p>OMG, restarting your server manually every time you make a change is so boring. <strong>Nodemon</strong> is your personal touch-up artist. It watches your files, and the second you save a change, it automatically restarts your server for you. It's a non-negotiable for fast, fabulous development.</p>

<h2>Environment Variables: Your Secret Notes</h2>
<p>Some things are meant to be kept private, like your secret crush or your API keys. <strong>Environment variables</strong> are where you store this secret info. They live outside your code, so you never accidentally share them with the world. You can access them in Node.js with `process.env`.</p>
<pre><code>
// In your terminal, you might set a variable like this:
// PORT=8080 node server.js

// In your server.js file
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000; // Use the secret PORT, or 3000 if it's not there.
</code></pre>

<h2>Clean Code: Flawless Presentation</h2>
<p>This is the most important rule of all: your code has to look good. A messy, unorganized codebase is the ultimate fashion faux pas. Use clear variable names, keep your functions small, and add comments where things are tricky. A clean look is always in style.</p>
