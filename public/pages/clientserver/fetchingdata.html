<h1>Fetching & Redirection: The A-List Communication</h1>
<p>Okay, so your front-row look is ready, but how does it interact with the world? It needs to get the latest deets from the server and know exactly where the after-party is. That's where fetching and redirection come in—it's all about that A-list communication.</p>

<h2>Fetching Data: Getting the 411</h2>
<p>The <strong>`fetch()`</strong> function is how your webpage texts the server to ask for info. It's the browser's built-in way to make HTTP requests to get data from your API without having to, like, refresh the whole page. So smooth!</p>
<pre><code>
// Let's ask the server for the entire outfit collection
fetch("/outfits")
  .then(response => response.json()) // First, get the response and turn it into something usable
  .then(data => {
    // Now you have the data! Time to show it off.
    console.log(data); 
  });
</code></pre>
<h3>Client vs. Backend Fetching</h3>
<p>Usually, the **client** (your browser) fetches from your server. But sometimes, your **backend** needs to fetch from another server (like a weather API). The code looks similar, but the key difference is *who* is making the call. The browser is like you asking for info, while the backend is like your personal assistant making a call on your behalf.</p>

<h2>Redirection: Making a Grand Entrance</h2>
<p>Redirection is all about moving from one page to another. But are you making the move yourself, or is a VIP escort telling you where to go?</p>

<h3>Client-Side: The Quick Outfit Change</h3>
<p>This is when the *browser* decides it's time to go to a new page. You use JavaScript to change the URL. It’s perfect for when something happens on the page, like after a user logs in successfully.</p>
<pre><code>
// You just logged in? Time for a new look on the dashboard page!
window.location.href = "/dashboard";
</code></pre>

<h3>Server-Side: The VIP Escort</h3>
<p>This is when the *server* tells the browser where to go. The server sends a special response that basically says, "OMG, you can't be here, go over there instead." The browser just follows orders. This is common for page security.</p>
<pre><code>
// In your Express server route
res.redirect("/login");
</code></pre>
