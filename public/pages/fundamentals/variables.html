<h1>Variables: Your Style Essentials ✨</h1>
<p>Okay, so let's talk about the absolute basics of your code's wardrobe: variables. Think of them like cute little boxes or designer bags where you store all your important stuff—your name, your age, your fave lipstick color. They hold onto your data so you can use it to create a totally stunning look later.</p>

<h2>Declaring Variables: The Labels</h2>
<p>In fashion, labels matter, and it's the same in code. You've got three main labels for declaring your variables: <strong>`const`</strong>, <strong>`let`</strong>, and the totally vintage <strong>`var`</strong>.</p>

<h3>`const`: Your Signature Piece</h3>
<p>Use <strong>`const`</strong> for things that are, like, totally permanent. It's for a value that you're never, ever going to change, like your name or your birthday. Once you set it, it's set for life. So loyal!</p>
<pre><code>
// This is my signature style, it's not changing!
const myName = "Yasmin";

// If you try to change it... DRAMA! This will cause an error.
// myName = "Cloe"; 
</code></pre>

<h3>`let`: Your Look of the Day</h3>
<p>Use <strong>`let`</strong> when you know your vibe might change. It's for values that can be updated, like your outfit of the day or your current mood. It's flexible and totally gets that sometimes you need to switch things up.</p>
<pre><code>
// My mood can totally change.
let myMood = "Fabulous";
myMood = "Extra Fabulous"; // See? Easy update.

console.log(myMood); // Outputs: Extra Fabulous
</code></pre>

<h3>`var`: So Last Season</h3>
<p>OMG, <strong>`var`</strong> is so vintage. It's from, like, before scoping was even a thing. It can be super confusing and cause major drama in your code. Just stick with `const` and `let`—they're way more in style.</p>

<h2>Data Types: The Textures & Fabrics</h2>
<p>Variables can hold all different kinds of data, just like your closet has different fabrics. Here's the 411 on the main types.</p>

<h3>The Main Clique (Primitive Types)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>String:</strong> Any text, duh. Always wrap it in quotes, like a secret. <code>"Slay!"</code></li>
    <li><strong>Number:</strong> For any number, like your shoe size or how many lip glosses you own. <code>25</code></li>
    <li><strong>Boolean:</strong> The ultimate yes or no. It's either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. No in-between.</li>
    <li><strong>Undefined:</strong> When a variable hasn't been given a value yet. It's like an empty shoebox.</li>
    <li><strong>Null:</strong> When you intentionally make a variable have no value. It's like, "I'm not wearing any accessories today."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Type Coercion: The Ultimate Fashion Faux Pas</h2>
<p><strong>Type Coercion</strong> is when JavaScript tries to guess what you mean and automatically changes a data type. It's like the computer trying to pick your outfit for you—total disaster! It can lead to some seriously weird results.</p>
<pre><code>
// JavaScript sees a string and a number and gets confused.
// It decides to just squish them together as a string.
const result = "My age is " + 21; 

console.log(result); // Outputs: "My age is 21" (as a string)

// This is even worse!
const weirdMath = "5" - 2;
console.log(weirdMath); // Outputs: 3 (a number... so confusing!)
</code></pre>
<p>Just be, like, super clear with your data types. If you need to combine things, make sure they're the same type first. It's the only way to guarantee a flawless look.</p>
