<h1>Functions: Your Signature Poses ðŸ’…</h1>
<p>Functions are, like, the most essential part of your coding wardrobe. They're reusable pieces of code that perform a specific action, just like a signature pose you can strike anytime. Without them, your code would be a total fashion disaster.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Function Declarations</h2>
<p>This is the classic, timeless way to define a function. It's like having a little black dress in your closetâ€”it's always in style and you can use it before you even declare it in your code (thanks to hoisting!).</p>
<pre><code>
// This function is ready for the runway!
function strikeAPose() {
  console.log("Fierce!");
}

// Call it whenever you're ready to slay.
strikeAPose(); // Outputs: Fierce!
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Function Expressions</h2>
<p>A function expression is a bit more modern and chic. You assign an unnamed (anonymous) function to a variable. It's less "look at me!" until you call it. Unlike declarations, you can't call these before you define them. You gotta get ready before you hit the catwalk.</p>
<pre><code>
const serveLook = function() {
  console.log("Serving a flawless look.");
};

// Now you can show it off.
serveLook(); // Outputs: Serving a flawless look.
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Arrow Functions =></h2>
<p>OMG, arrow functions are the hottest trend. They're super cute, short, and totally change the game. They have a sleek syntax and are perfect for quick, one-liner actions.</p>
<pre><code>
// A simple, stylin' arrow function.
const blowAKiss = () => console.log("Mwah! ðŸ’‹");

blowAKiss(); // Outputs: Mwah! ðŸ’‹
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Parameters & Arguments</h2>
<p>Think of **parameters** as the list of accessories a look *needs* (like `outfit` and `shoes`). **Arguments** are the *actual* designer items you use when you create the look (like `"sequin dress"` and `"stilettos"`).</p>
<pre><code>
// 'outfit' and 'shoes' are the parameters.
function createLook(outfit, shoes) {
  console.log(`My look is a ${outfit} with ${shoes}.`);
}

// '"vintage top"' and '"platform boots"' are the arguments.
createLook("vintage top", "platform boots");
// Outputs: My look is a vintage top with platform boots.
</code></pre>

<h2>Callbacks: The BFFs of Functions</h2>
<p>A callback is a function you pass into another function as an argument. It's like telling your BFF to call you back *after* she gets the party deets. It's all about timing and making sure things happen in the right order.</p>
<pre><code>
function getReady(callback) {
  console.log("Doing my hair and makeup...");
  // After getting ready, the callback function (arriveAtParty) is called.
  callback();
}

function arriveAtParty() {
  console.log("Okay, I've arrived at the party! ðŸŽ‰");
}

// Pass arriveAtParty as the callback.
getReady(arriveAtParty);
</code></pre>
